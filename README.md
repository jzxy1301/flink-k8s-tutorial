## Flink session cluster on Kubernetes
>A Flink session cluster is executed as a long-running Kubernetes Deployment. Note that you can run multiple Flink jobs on a session cluster. Each job needs to be submitted to the cluster after the cluster has been deployed.

>A basic Flink session cluster deployment in Kubernetes has three components:

> 1. a Deployment/Job which runs the JobManager
> 2. a Deployment for a pool of TaskManagers
> 3. a Service exposing the JobManagerâ€™s REST and UI ports
